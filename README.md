# ML_Project-Medical_Insurance_Cost_Prediction ðŸ’°ðŸ’Š

This project explores the task of predicting medical insurance costs using a **Linear Regression** model. By analyzing various features related to an individual's health and lifestyle, the model aims to estimate the likely insurance charges.

## Data
This directory contains the dataset (`insurance.csv`) used for the project. The dataset includes the following features:

- **Age**: Age of the individual.
- **Sex**: Gender of the individual (male or female).
- **BMI**: Body Mass Index (a measure of body fat based on height and weight).
- **Children**: Number of children/dependents.
- **Smoker**: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes or no).
- **Region**: Geographic region (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
- **Charges**: Actual medical insurance cost (target variable).

> **Note:** You may need to adjust the dataset features based on your specific project requirements.

## Notebooks
This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook (`insurance_cost_prediction.ipynb`) that guides you through the entire process of data exploration, preprocessing, model training using linear regression, evaluation, and visualization.

## Running the Project
The Jupyter Notebook (`insurance_cost_prediction.ipynb`) walks through the following steps:

### Data Loading and Exploration:
- Load the dataset and explore basic statistics.
- Visualize relationships between features and the target variable (`charges`).

### Data Preprocessing:
- Handle missing values (if any).
- Scale numerical features like `age` and `BMI`.
- Encode categorical variables (e.g., `sex`, `smoker`, `region`).

### Train-Test Split:
- The data is split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from the `sklearn` library, with a typical 80-20 or 70-30 ratio for training and testing, respectively.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### Feature Engineering (Optional):
- Creates additional features (e.g., interactions between features).
- Analyzes correlations between features and the target variable.

### Model Training with Linear Regression:
- Trains the model, potentially tuning hyperparameters for improved performance.

### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluates model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Visualization of Results:
- Analyzes the confusion matrix to understand model performance on different categories.
- Visualizes feature importance to explore the impact of specific features on model predictions.

## Customization
Modify the Jupyter Notebook to:
- Experiment with different preprocessing techniques and feature engineering methods.
- Try other classification algorithms for comparison (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines).
- Explore advanced techniques like deep learning models specifically designed for medical prediction.

## Further Contributions
Extend this project by:
- Incorporating additional health metrics or data from electronic health records.
- Implementing a real-time diabetes prediction system using a trained model and an API.
- Exploring explainability techniques to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.

By leveraging Linear Regression and medical insurance data processing techniques, we can analyze health metrics and potentially build a model to predict diabetes onset. This project provides a foundation for further exploration in diabetes prediction and health monitoring.
